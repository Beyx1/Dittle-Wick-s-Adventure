        <p>You are Dittle Wick. You are a duck. You find a three-way cross road that leads to 3 different locations. However, rumor has it that 2 out of the three locations are run down by a species of bandits called Gobble Nobbles. Your goal is to determine which of the three locations will keep you safe from coming into any contact with any Gobble Nobbles. Where will you go?</p>
